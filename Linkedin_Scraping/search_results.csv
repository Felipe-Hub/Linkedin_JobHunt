Job Description

The next great shift in consumer behaviour driven by technological disruption is underway, and it’s happening in the food & beverage industry.

As other sectors have shifted to eCommerce-first business models in recent years, food & beverage has continued to rely predominantly on traditional brick & mortar models, but this is changing rapidly. New technologies are transforming every aspect of reaching consumers, from the rise of digital marketing and online grocery platforms to the creation of supply chain tools that enable speedy at-home delivery. According to the Food Marketing Institute, 70% of U.S. consumers will shop online for groceries by 2024, with an estimated annual spend of $100 billion.

To deepen our efforts to seize this opportunity and lead the food & beverage industry into its remarkable next chapter, PepsiCo – a global company with powerhouse brands including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker, and Tropicana – is expanding its Global eCommerce Team. We’re looking for the greatest minds in data & analytics, software development, machine learning optimization, and next-generation supply chain. Given PepsiCo’s incredible reach – our foods and beverages are enjoyed more than one billion times a day in more than 200 countries and territories, and our value chain involves diverse partners ranging from farmers and food scientists to retailers and logistics specialists – the challenges we’re addressing are complex and the solutions will be deeply impactful.

Although PepsiCo is a large multinational, the PepsiCo Global eCommerce Team prides itself on having the entrepreneurial, action-oriented culture of an exciting startup business. Our group includes startup founders, Silicon Valley veterans, food & beverage experts, and seasoned executives from digital transformation leaders such as Amazon and Walmart. Our goal is to build the technological products and capabilities that will reinvent our industry and make us the #1 food & beverage business in eCommerce for decades to come.

The Catalog Engineering team has an opening for a backend data engineer who would help architect, code, and lay the foundation for the PepsiCo’s eCommerce platform. The PepsiCo Data Engineering team is collaborative, impact-focused, and hold each other to a high-quality standard with code review. Engineer's own projects end to end. You will work closely with our business partners and identify the customer pain point, architect a well-crafted solution, and deploy at scale.

663,Data Engineer and Analyst,Northeastern University,Greater Boston,,4 months ago,"About Northeastern

Founded in 1898, Northeastern is a global research university and the recognized leader in experience-driven lifelong learning. Our world-renowned experiential approach empowers our students, faculty, alumni, and partners to create impact far beyond the confines of discipline, degree, and campus.

Our locations—in Boston; Charlotte, North Carolina; London; Portland, Maine; San Francisco; Seattle; Silicon Valley; Toronto; Vancouver; and the Massachusetts communities of Burlington and Nahant—are nodes in our growing global university system. Through this network, we expand opportunities for flexible, student-centered learning and collaborative, solutions-focused research.

Northeastern’s comprehensive array of undergraduate and graduate programs— in a variety of on-campus and online formats—lead to degrees through the doctorate in nine colleges and schools. Among these, we offer more than 195 multi-discipline majors and degrees designed to prepare students for purposeful lives and careers.



Overseen by the Associate Vice Provost for Institutional Research and Decision Support, the University Decision Support (UDS) unit provides timely information and analysis to the Northeastern University community to enable evidence-driven decision making and planning. Analysts within the unit provide research and data analysis to university decision-makers in support of planning, accreditation, and budgeting; produce and disseminate reports offering insight into the progress and performance of Northeastern; and assess and evaluate Northeastern’s academic, administrative, and co-curricular initiatives. UDS is also responsible for the submission of voluntary or required data to external entities, including government agencies, accreditors, professional organizations, college rankings, guidebooks, and other media outlets. To accomplish these efforts and meet the internal and external data needs of the university, UDS analysts produce, refine, and maintain a variety of “self-service” data tools; respond to annual external data requests or requirements; respond to ad hoc internal data requests, and engage in any other data analysis and research, as needed. In addition, UDS is home to the university’s data administration group, which manages and facilitates data governance to maximize the value extracted from the university’s data assets. In summary, UDS is a source of information, expertise, and guidance for data consumers throughout the university, that seeks to promote, influence, and advance a culture of shared knowledge by making data accessible to faculty and staff in accordance with their role and purpose.



UDS is seeking a Data Engineer and Analyst to develop data sources that will play a key role in efficient internal and external reporting and build the unit’s overall analytic capacities. Reporting to the Director for Institutional Research, the Data Engineer and Analyst will work side by side with UDS analysts to identify common data constructs and metrics that are required by external entities such as IPEDS, US News & World Report, the Princeton Review, and many other guidebooks, rankings, and publications. The Data Engineer and Analyst will delve into existing, complex university data sources of structured and semi-structured data, combine them when necessary, clean the resulting data, and build calculated variables where needed to create curated datasets that are easily consumable for analysis and that are aligned to external reporting needs. The Data Engineer and Analyst will build expertise on the university’s robust Operational Data Store (ODS), and will draw from the ODS, along with other university data sources as needed, to develop smaller, focused datasets for specific purposes that can be used by analysts across the office. The Data Engineer and Analyst is responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining the resulting datasets, and for training other UDS analysts on the included variables and their associated definitions.

The UDS office regularly receives requests for various data and metrics from individuals across the university; external requests for data from entities such as IPEDS, US News & World Report, the Princeton Review, and many other guidebooks, rankings, and publications; and requests for support with data compilation and presentation in preparation for programmatic, college, or university accreditation and approval. On occasion, the Data Engineer and Analyst will also be responsible for supporting the fulfillment of these data requests. The balance between data engineering responsibilities and data analyst responsibilities will vary over time. In general, the role will focus on data engineering and the curation of datasets for analysis and reporting; however, during times of high need, the Data Engineer and Analyst will also be responsible for querying, compiling, and analyzing data to fulfill incoming requests.





The role of Data Engineer and Analyst will require strong technical expertise, in addition to strong written and verbal communication skills. A learning mentality is desirable—an interest in expanding upon existing skill sets, learning new technical skills, and participating in informal and formal learning opportunities is strongly preferred. This position involves a significant amount of time working independently on a computer; however, it also involves interaction with others, and requires a customer service mentality in order to adequately respond to requests from both university offices and external agencies. The Data Engineer and Analyst must have strong technical and analytic skills, the capacity to work with large-scale datasets, be detail-oriented, and have a strong commitment to data quality and accuracy. The Data Engineer and Analyst must have the ability to think critically and analytically, work independently, problem solve, and handle multiple concurrent tasks and projects with a variety of internal and external deadlines. An advanced knowledge of SQL and relational databases is required. Advanced Excel, Hyperion/BRIO, Toad, Toad Intelligence Central, Cognos, Tableau, Alteryx, or similar data analysis and visualization tools is strongly preferred.
